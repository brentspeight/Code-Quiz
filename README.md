As a coding bootcamp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. 
Ive created 5 questions in which the user has to answer correctly, there is a timer of 75 seconds, once the timer hits 0 the quiz will stop the fucntionality of the application and display the score for the quiz. If the user gets a question wrong thre will be a deduction of 15 seconds from the timer and the question will not proceed to the next. If the question is right it will proceed the the next.
